README assets helper

Place screenshots and GIFs in this folder with the following recommended filenames:

- session-screenshot.png -> Screenshot of two connected terminals with messages
- build-screenshot.png -> Screenshot showing `make` and the compiled `s-talk`
- quick-demo.gif -> Short GIF (3-6s) showing typing, message exchange, and graceful exit

Recording tips:
- Use `asciinema` and `svg-term-cli` for lightweight terminal GIFs, or record with a screen capture tool and convert to GIF with `ffmpeg`.
- For terminal-only GIFs, keep the terminal font large and set a neutral background so text is legible when embedded in the README.

How to add images to README.md:

1. Add the files to this `assets/` directory.
2. Reference them in `README.md` using relative paths, e.g. `![Session](assets/session-screenshot.png)`.

If you'd like, I can add markdown image placeholders to `README.md` once you provide the screenshots or tell me to use placeholders instead.
