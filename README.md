# IPC-Chat

A "chat"-like program that allows someone at the terminal to communicate with someone at another terminal.

## Usage

To run this program, call the executable "./s-talk", followed by: [my port number] [remote machine name] [remote port number].

To exit the program, a single user should press the '!' key and enter. Keep in mind that both users should be connected for this exit procedure to work properly.

Call "make" to build the executable, and "make clean" to delete .o files.
